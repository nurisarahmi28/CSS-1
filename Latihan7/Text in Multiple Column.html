                        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
                    Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standart dummy text ever since the 1500s,
                    when an unknown printer took a galery of ype and scrambled it to make a type
                    specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
                    electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in
                    the 1960s with the release of the Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
                    and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus pageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

                        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable
                        content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is
                        that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using
                         'content here,content here' making it look like readable English. Many desktop 
                         publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model
                         text, and a search for 'Lorem Ipsum' will uncover many web sites stil in their infancy.
                         Various versions have evolved over the years,sometimes by accident,sometimes on 
                         purpose(injected humour and the like.)
